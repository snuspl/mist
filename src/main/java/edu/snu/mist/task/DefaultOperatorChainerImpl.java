/**
 * This is a default implementation of operator chaining.
 *
 * [Mechanism]
 * 1) It chains sequential operators until it meets an operator that has branch or multiple incoming edges.
 * For example, if operators are connected sequentially,
 *    - ex) op1 -> op2 -> op3,
 * Then, it chains all of the operators [op1 -> op2 -> op3]
 *
 * 2) It splits a DAG of operators if branches exist.
 * For example, if an operator has two next operators (it has a branch)
 *    - ex) ... op1 -> op2 ... (op1 has multiple next operators)
 *                  -> op3 ...
 * Then, it splits the op1, op2 and op3 and chains them separately
 * (The bracket [ .. ] represents a chain of operators)
 *    - ex) [... op1] -> [op2 ... ]
 *                    -> [op3 ... ]
 *
 * 3) It splits a DAG of operator if there exist operators which have multiple incoming edges
 * (Two different input streams are merged into one operator).
 *   - ex) ... op1 -> op3 ... (op3 has multiple incoming edges)
 *         ... op2 ->
 * Then, it splits the op1, op2 and op3 and chains them separately
 *   - ex) [... op1] -> [op3 ...]
 *         [... op2] ->
 *
 * The different OperatorChains are allocated to multiple MistExecutors.
 * But, they can be executed on the same MistExecutor according to the allocation policy.
